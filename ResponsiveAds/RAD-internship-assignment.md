Here is a copy of the question code:

```js
// You have an array.
// An item of the array has `name`, a string, and `types`, an array of strings.
// The length of `types` in a record can be 1-99 (not always 1-2)
// e.g. [{ name: "bulbasaur", types: ["grass", "poison"] }]
const pokes = getPokes();
console.log("Pokes", pokes);

// Problem 1: Filter by type
// - Populate `answer1` with Pokemon names that contain the type string
const type = "grass";
const answer1 = []; // TODO

// Problem 2: Filter by types (AND / OR)
// - Populate `answer2Or` with Pokemon names that satisfy AT LEAST ONE of the given types
// - Populate `answer2And` with Pokemon names that satisfy ALL of the given types
// (Note that the length of the given `types` can be 1-99. (not always 1-2))
const types = ["bug", "poison"];
const answer2Or = []; // TODO
const answer2And = []; // TODO
```
